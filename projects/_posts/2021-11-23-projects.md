## Out-of-the-box outside-of-the-box thinking with BraketLab

I wrote this Python module in order to explore how computational aspects like visualization, numerics and interactivity may be used in learning quantum theory. 

I consider it out-of-the-box since it is available with a simple 'pip install braketlab', and 'outside-of-the-box' since it paves the way for getting quite creative in the way we learn quantum theory. In a few lines of code, you may apply the variational principle to explore whatever potential you may conjure up. Quantum systems of any dimensionality can easily be constructed and explored.
